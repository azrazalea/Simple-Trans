üè• **Major Medical System Update**
- Complete surgery system: organ transplantation, basic/bionic prosthetics, with ideology(if present) gender affirming biosculpter cycle
- Capability-specific sterilization (carry vs sire) with backwards compatibility that tries to cover vanilla sterilization
- Updated pawn generation to be able to generate all possiblities, and added more settings.
- Comprehensive safety features: informed consent dialogs, pregnancy preservation/termination warnings
- Enhanced vanilla surgery integration (vasectomy, IUD, embryo implantation now work with carry/sire system)
- **PREGNANCY SYSTEM OVERHAUL**: All pregnancy compatibility checks now use carry/sire capabilities instead of gender
- **COMPREHENSIVE DEBUG LOGGING**: Extensive debug mode for testing pregnancy/romance mod compatibility
- Full gene system compatibility and improved mod integration with Intimacy and Non-Binary Gender. Patches Intimacy and non-binary gender to work together.
  - Non-binary people are just attractive to everyone in current implementation. I hope to improve this in the future.
  - I've done basic tests on this but more extensive testing is needed.
- See updated steam workshop page for more details

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This update involved extensive code changes including a complete pregnancy system rewrite. The mod now overrides ALL vanilla pregnancy logic to support trans individuals and prosthetics properly.

üîß **For Mod Compatibility Testing:** Enable debug mode in mod settings to get detailed logs of all pregnancy/romance decisions - essential for testing compatibility with mods like Intimacy, Way Better Romance, etc.

This update transforms Simple Trans from a basic gender identity mod into a comprehensive medical system for reproductive healthcare in RimWorld.
