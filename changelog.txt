[*] Added incompatibility for the new [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3534254491]Intimacy Gender Works[/url] mod

[h1] July 15th, 2025 [/h1]
[*] Fixed bugs with ideology ritual making it not work correctly
[*] Added a NASTY non-binary attraction hack to make it possible to run Non-Binary gender, simple trans, intimacy, and way better romance together.
  [*] Only activates if Non-Binary gender is present.
  [*] Probably has bugs, but I've been running it for days without issues in my personal colony. My non-binary pawn is very popular!
  [*] NOT a long-term fix. What it does is makes everyone think non-binary people are attractive, and make non-binary people think everyone is attractive.
  [*] Long term fix is going to be provide by colloboration with way better romance author, but may be some ways off.

[*] Hotfix VEF gender gene patch due to crash at initialize
  [*] This also was fixed to be simpler, prefix patch instead of transpiler, but I haven't had time to completely test it so keep an eye on it.

[h1] July 10th, 2025 [/h1]
[*]Revamped xml loading to actually completely remove objects when toggles are off
[*]Added settings to toggle ideology ritual and biosculpter cycle
[*]Tweaked replace organs surgery code so that if world pawn generation calls it you don't get a big warning in logs
[*]Improved debug log when pawn is generated successfully to include the gender
[*]Conslidated folder structure

[h1] July 9th, 2025 [/h1]
[*]Removed support for RimWorld 1.5, please use original simple trans mod if you are on 1.5.
[*]Conslidated and cleaned up debug messages to make them a bit less noisy while still providing good information.
[*]Updated XML Extensions settings to apply on close of settings menu, should allow pawn generation settings to immediately take affect.
[*]Updated preview image for workshop.
[*]Rewrote settings xml to better use XML Extensions features and fix some weird slider UI bugs. I don't like the layout as much, but it works now.
[*]Quick hotfix because rimworld didn't like the new languages folder location
