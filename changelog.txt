[*] Fixed bugs with ideology ritual making it not work correctly
[*] Added a NASTY non-binary attraction hack to make it possible to run Non-Binary gender, simple trans, intimacy, and way better romance together.
  [*] Only activates if Non-Binary gender is present.
  [*] Probably has bugs, but I've been running it for days without issues in my personal colony. My non-binary pawn is very popular!
  [*] NOT a long-term fix. What it does is makes everyone think non-binary people are attractive, and make non-binary people think everyone is attractive.
  [*] Long term fix is going to be provide by colloboration with way better romance author, but may be some ways off.

[*]Updated XML Extensions settings to apply on close of settings menu, should allow pawn generation settings to immediately take affect.
[*]Updated preview image for workshop.
