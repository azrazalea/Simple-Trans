üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è **Simple Trans - Gender Identity & Reproductive Biology System**

*Continued from Runaway's original mod, completely rebuilt for RimWorld 1.6*

---

**Core Concept**

Separates gender identity from reproductive biology using RimWorld's hediff system. Instead of gender determining fertility, pawns get individual reproductive capabilities and gender identities that can be medically modified.

Trans rights are human rights. If you're here to complain, please leave.

**How It Works**

**Gender Identity Hediffs**
- Pawns spawn with "Cisgender" or "Transgender" hediffs (configurable spawn rates)
- Separate "Carrying Capability" and "Siring Capability" hediffs control reproduction
- Pregnancy systems check these hediffs instead of gender
- All percentages configurable in mod settings

**Medical Systems**

üî¨ **Organ Transplantation**
- Extract reproductive organs from one pawn, transplant to another
- Extracted organs maintain their type (natural carrying/siring anatomy)
- Surgery can fail, potentially causing capability-specific sterilization
- Pregnancy is safely terminated if carry organs are removed

ü¶æ **Prosthetic Systems** 
- **Basic Prosthetics**: 70% fertility rate compared to natural anatomy
- **Bionic Prosthetics**: 120% fertility rate with perfect contraception control
- When both partners have matching bionics and want children: 100% pregnancy chance
- When either partner with bionics wants to avoid pregnancy: 0% chance
- Prosthetics are additional hediffs that work alongside base capabilities

üß¨ **Biosculpter Cycles** (5 specialized procedures)
- **Masculinizing Treatments**: Male gender + body type + sire capability + cisgender identity
- **Feminizing Treatments**: Female gender + body type + carry capability + cisgender identity  
- **Fertility Restoration**: Removes all sterilization, restores natural reproductive abilities
- **Androgynizing**: Non-binary gender + thin body + removes all reproductive capabilities
- **Duosex Transformation**: Grants both carry AND sire capabilities simultaneously

**Safety & Consent System**
- Comprehensive informed consent dialogs for irreversible procedures
- Pregnancy preservation warnings with detailed change summaries
- Color-coded UI showing exactly what will happen
- Most changes can be undone through additional medical procedures

**Technical Details**

**Sterilization System**
- Capability-specific sterilization: "SterilizedCarry" vs "SterilizedSire" hediffs
- Failed surgeries apply appropriate sterilization type (tubal ligation ‚Üí carry sterility)
- Backwards compatibility converts vanilla "Sterilized" based on gender identity
- Fertility restoration removes all sterilization types

**Gene Integration** 
- Vanilla Expanded Framework genes can force gender identity
- Configurable: genes represent assigned gender at birth OR current identity
- Body type changes respect cisgender status (won't alter cis pawns' appearance)
- Gene-gender conflicts handled intelligently

**Mod Compatibility**
- **SameSex IVF**: Handles ovum extraction, embryo implantation works with carry capability
- **Non-Binary Gender**: Full integration, special spawn rates for non-binary reproductive configs
- **Biotech**: Complete pregnancy system override - all pregnancy checks use carry/sire capabilities
- **Romance Mods**: Full compatibility testing with comprehensive debug logging system
- Harmony patches completely override vanilla gender-based pregnancy logic

---

**Debug Tools**

Comprehensive debug system:
- **Debug Mode Toggle**: Enable extensive logging for pregnancy/romance mechanics (perfect for testing mod compatibility)
- **Dev Mode Actions**: Validate gender assignments, set identities, modify capabilities
- **Compatibility Testing**: Detailed logs show exactly how pregnancy decisions are made
- **Mod Integration**: Debug logs help diagnose conflicts with romance/pregnancy mods like Intimacy

**Requirements & Load Order**

**Required:**
- Harmony (brrainz.harmony)
- XML Extensions (imranfish.xmlextensions) 
- Vanilla Expanded Framework (OskarPotocki.VanillaFactionsExpanded.Core)

**Load Order:** Must load AFTER Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded

**Recommended:** 
- SameSex IVF - Enhanced reproductive options
- Non-Binary Gender - Adds non-binary gender options
- Way Better Romance - Enhanced romance mechanics
- Intimacy - Currently testing compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è **Compatibility Notes:** 
- Don't use Way Better Romance + Non-Binary Gender together (known incompatibility between those mods)
- Don't use Intimacy + Non-Binary Gender together (known incompatibility between those mods)

**About This Version**

Originally by Runaway for RimWorld 1.5, this continuation was completely decompiled and rebuilt with:
- Modern C# practices and comprehensive error handling
- Extensive new medical systems (surgery, prosthetics, biosculpter integration)
- Safety features and informed consent dialogs
- Enhanced mod compatibility and gene system integration

The original philosophy remains: providing meaningful representation for transgender colonists in RimWorld through detailed, respectful gameplay mechanics.
