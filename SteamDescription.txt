[h1]🏳️‍⚧️ Simple Trans (Expanded) - Gender Identity & Reproductive Biology System[/h1]

[i]Continued from Runaway's original mod, completely rebuilt for RimWorld 1.6+ ONLY[/i]
[i]⚠️ If you are on Rimworld 1.5 please use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3345402828]the original Simple Trans mod[/url]![/i]

[b][u]⚠️ I CHANGED NEARLY ALL OF THE CODE, PLEASE EXPECT BUGS AND REPORT THEM WITH LOGS AND/OR SAVE FILES[/u][/b]

[hr]

[h2]📋 REQUIREMENTS - READ FIRST[/h2]

[b]REQUIRED:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Biotech DLC[/b]
[*]Harmony (brrainz.harmony)
[*]XML Extensions (imranfish.xmlextensions) 
[*]Vanilla Expanded Framework (OskarPotocki.VanillaFactionsExpanded.Core)
[/list]

[b]LOAD ORDER:[/b] Must load AFTER Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded

[b]COMPATIBILITY:[/b]
[list]
[*]✅ [b]Intimacy[/b] - Full compatibility 
[*]✅ [b]Non-Binary Gender[/b] - Full integration. For now everyone thinks non-binary people are attractive. Reproduction handled as well.
[*]✅ [b]Intimacy + Way Better Romance + Non Binary Gender[/b] - Full compatibility (these work together with Simple Trans thanks to a NASTY HACK making non-binary gender attractive to everyone)
[*]✅ [b]Vanilla Framework Expanded[/b] - Full integration with gene systems
[*]❌ [b]Same Sex IVF[/b] - No longer recommended (Simple Trans handles IVF independently via carry/sire system)
[/list]

[h2]⚠️ If you are adding mid-save, go to development mode and Debug Tools and click "Validate All Genders" to get reproductive capability and gender identity set for existing pawns. Then there are debug tools to customize further if you want specific pawns to be setup certain ways![/h2]

[hr]

[h2]💡 Core Concept[/h2]

Separates gender identity from reproductive biology using RimWorld's hediff system. Instead of gender determining fertility, pawns get individual reproductive capabilities and gender identities that can be medically modified.

[b]Trans rights are human rights. If you're here to complain, please leave.[/b]

[hr]

[h2]⚙️ How It Works[/h2]

[h3]Gender Identity Hediffs[/h3]
[list]
[*]Pawns spawn with "Cisgender" or "Transgender" hediffs (configurable spawn rates)
[*]They can spawn with all variations possible in the mod
[*]Config sliders available to control spawn percentages
[*]Separate "Carrying Capability" and "Siring Capability" hediffs control reproduction
[*]Updated fertility + IVF surgeries work based on reproductive capabilities, not gender
[*]All percentages configurable in mod settings
[/list]

[h3]Medical Systems[/h3]

[b]🔬 Organ Transplantation[/b]
[list]
[*]Extract reproductive organs from one pawn, transplant to another
[*]Extracted organs maintain their type (natural carrying/siring anatomy)
[*]Surgery can fail, potentially causing capability-specific sterilization
[*]Pregnancy is safely terminated if carry organs are removed, there is a warning presented first
[*]Children genetically born from transplanted reproductive organs are considered the genetic child of the person currently possessing the organs
[*]There might be an optional system for making this be the original organ genetics in the future
[/list]

[b]🦾 Prosthetic Systems[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Basic Prosthetics:[/b] 70% fertility rate compared to natural anatomy
[*][b]Bionic Prosthetics:[/b] 120% fertility rate with perfect contraception control
[*]When both partners have matching bionics and want children: 100% pregnancy chance
[*]When either partner with bionics wants to avoid pregnancy: 0% chance
[*]Prosthetics are additional hediffs that work alongside base capabilities
[/list]

[hr]

[h2]🎭 Ideology DLC Features[/h2]
[i](optional, mod does not require ideology)[/i]

[b]🎉 Gender Affirmation Party Ritual[/b] (Ideology DLC only)
[list]
[*]Ritual for changing Name and Gender identity
[*]Community celebration of gender transition
[*]Provides mood bonuses and social recognition
[/list]

[b]🧬 Biosculpter Gender Affirming Cycle[/b] (Ideology DLC only)
[list]
[*][b]Body type transformation:[/b] Changes physical appearance
[*]Currently only the vanilla body types but I want to work on adding modded ones as well in the future
[*][b]Reproductive organ modification:[/b] Alters reproductive capabilities
[*]This will remove prosthetics if present to replace with natural
[*]Cures all sterilizations
[/list]

[hr]

[h2]🛡️ Safety & Consent System[/h2]

[list]
[*]Comprehensive informed consent dialogs for irreversible procedures
[*]Pregnancy preservation warnings with detailed change summaries
[*]Color-coded UI showing exactly what will happen
[*]Changes can be undone through additional medical or social procedures
[/list]

[hr]

[h2]🔧 Technical Details[/h2]

[h3]Sterilization System[/h3]
[list]
[*]Capability-specific sterilization: "SterilizedCarry" vs "SterilizedSire" hediffs
[*]Failed surgeries apply appropriate sterilization type (tubal ligation → carry sterility)
[*]Backwards compatibility converts vanilla "Sterilized" to correct guess based on gender identity
[/list]

[h3]Gene Integration[/h3]
[list]
[*]Vanilla Expanded Framework genes can force gender identity
[*]Configurable: genes represent assigned gender at birth OR current identity
[*]Body type changes respect cisgender status (won't alter cis pawns' appearance)
[*]Gene-gender conflicts handled intelligently
[*]HAR support in the future
[/list]

[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]Biotech:[/b] Complete pregnancy system override using carry/sire capabilities
[*][b]Intimacy:[/b] Full compatibility with debug logging (enable in settings for detailed reports)
[*][b]Non-Binary Gender:[/b] Full integration with special spawn rates. Currently everyone is attracted to non-binary pawns (will improve in future in the future).
[*][b]Vanilla Framework Expanded:[/b] Complete gene system integration
[*][b]HAR:[/b] Planned support
[*][b]Way Better Romance:[/b] Compatible (better integration planned)
[/list]

[hr]

[h2]🐛 Debug Tools[/h2]

[list]
[*][b]Debug Mode:[/b] Extensive logging for pregnancy/romance mechanics and mod compatibility testing
[*][b]Dev Actions:[/b] Validate genders, set identities, modify capabilities
[*][b]Compatibility Testing:[/b] Detailed logs for diagnosing mod conflicts

[h2]📖 About This Version[/h2]

Originally by Runaway, this continuation was completely decompiled and rebuilt with:
[list]
[*]Modern C# practices and comprehensive error handling
[*]Extensive new medical systems (surgery, prosthetics, biosculpter integration)
[*]Safety features and informed consent dialogs

[/list]

The original philosophy remains: providing meaningful representation for transgender colonists in RimWorld through detailed, respectful gameplay mechanics.
