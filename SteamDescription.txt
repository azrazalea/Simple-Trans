 üîÑ NEW AUTHOR UPDATE - RimWorld 1.6 Compatible

  This is a continued version of the original Simple Trans mod by Runaway, completely decompiled and modernized for
   RimWorld 1.6 compatibility. The original mod was created for RimWorld 1.5.

  Original Author: Runaway
  Current Maintainer: azrazalea
  Source: Decompiled and modernized from original mod
  Versions: RimWorld 1.5 (legacy), 1.6+ (actively maintained)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Version Note: While this mod supports both RimWorld 1.5 and 1.6, only the 1.6 version receives updates and
  improvements. The 1.5 version remains available as-is from the original mod but will not receive new features or
  fixes.

  What This Mod Does

  This mod adds a comprehensive system for differentiating how pawns interact with pregnancy and AGAR (Assigned
  Gender at Rimworld). This mod was inspired by frustration with other options for having explicitly trans pawns.
  No shade on RJW, Universal Pregnancy, or Dysphoria, but none of those were what the original author was looking
  for.

  Trans rights are human rights. If you are here to complain about the existence of this mod, please leave. You have
   the ability to not click into this mod if you don't like the idea. Goodbye.

  Core Features

  Gender Identity System:

  - Pawns are assigned carrier or sire capabilities based on gender identity and configurable percentages
  - Pregnancy systems check against ability to carry or sire instead of gender
  - Lovin' pregnancy chance checks against reproductive capabilities instead of gender

  Compatibility:
  - Gender-restricting genes work correctly with Vanilla Extended Framework

  Dev Mode Tools

  Comprehensive debugging options:
  - Validate all Humanlike genders: checks if all generated pawns have valid cis/trans + carry/sire status
  - Set Transgender/Cisgender: manage gender identity of target pawns
  - Clear ST hediffs: clears cis/trans/carry/sire from target pawn
  - Set reproductive abilities: manage carry/sire capabilities
  - Regenerate ST hediffs: completely refresh gender assignments

  This mod should be mid-save safe!

  Incompatible Mods

  ---
  Known Issues

  About This Continuation

  This version was created by completely decompiling the original mod using ILSpy and modernizing the entire
  codebase for RimWorld 1.6. The original concept, design, and philosophy remain unchanged - this is purely a
  technical update to preserve the mod's functionality for current RimWorld versions.

  All credit for the original design and implementation goes to Runaway. This continuation focuses on technical
  modernization, stability improvements, and ensuring compatibility with RimWorld 1.6+.

  The original mod's message remains unchanged: This mod exists to provide representation and gameplay options for
  transgender pawns in RimWorld. Trans rights are human rights.
